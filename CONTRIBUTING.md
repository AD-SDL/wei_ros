## Developing rpl_wei

To develop rpl_wei on your machine, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone a copy of rpl_wei from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl_wei.git
cd rpl_wei
```

2. If you already have rpl_wei from source, update it:

```
git pull
```

3. Install rpl_wei in `develop` mode:

```
conda create -n rpl-wei python=3.9
conda activate rpl-wei
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip3 install -r requirements/dev.txt
pip3 install -r requirements/requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
```

This mode will symlink the Python files from the current local source tree into the Python install.
Hence, if you modify a Python file, you do not need to reinstall rpl_wei again and again.

4. Ensure that you have a working `rpl_wei` installation by running:

```
python3 -c "import rpl_wei; print(rpl_wei.__version__)"
```

5. To run dev tools (isort, flake8, black):

```
make
```

## Unit Testing

1. [Build and install](#developing-rpl_wei) rpl_wei from source.
2. The `requirements/dev.txt` contains the additional testing dependencies.
3. Run the test suite: `pytest test -vs`

If contributing, please add a `test_<module_name>.py` in the `test/` directory
in a subdirectory that matches the rpl_wei package directory structure. Inside,
`test_<module_name>.py` implement test functions using pytest.
