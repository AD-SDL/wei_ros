# WEI Examples


## How to run it:
  1 - Make sure sealer, peeler and hudson are all connected to parker <br>
  2 - For sanity sake. I also rebooted parker to make sure there were no other running nodes. <br>
  3 - Install packages <br>
  4 - Run ros nodes  <br>
  5 - Run the script


## Installing the example

```
./install.sh
```
## Running the example

```
./run_nodes
```

And finally run the scripts with the steps you want to test

```
./~/wei_ws/src/wei_ros/examples/test_wf.py
```
